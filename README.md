**0 to 700: My Journey in Kattis**

My goal is to hit 700 points in Kattis by November 2023. As of 29 June 2023, I am at 170.8 points. 

Update: small steps really help. It is 10 July 2023 and I am now at 233.9 points. 300, here we go.

Another update: As of 19 July 2023, I hit 300.7 points! It's racking up very fast. I'll try and hit 500 points before the semester starts. About 18 days to go.

Yet another update (this is getting monotonous): I am at 331.1 points. Also, I hit a rating of 907 in Codeforces. I did it through Div 3 / 4 competitions, but that's fine, we all start somewhere.

Update: It is 3 August 2023. I am at 460 points. I'll hit 500 tomorrow.
